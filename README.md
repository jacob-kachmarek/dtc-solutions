## Description 
This app is designed for mechanics and any vehicle owner. When you get a check engine light there is a corresponding DTC (diagnostic trouble code) associated with that check engine light. Looking up and locating what these dtc codes mean can be a pain and often times misleading. With this app that is a thing of the past. On the landing page simply input your dtc code into the search bar. When you press enter or click the search button you will be presented with your code what the code means and its potential causes. We added a problem complexity level in order to assist the everyday driver. The harder the issue the more likely they are going to need an expert to look at their car. This app also makes it easy to locate a mechanic with the map and search function. You can visit the deployed site[here.](https://jacob-kachmarek.github.io/dtc-solutions/) Here are a couple picture of the site![Landing Page](./assets/images/DTC%20solutions%20home%20page.png)<br>![Results Page](./assets/images/DTC%20solutions%20results%20page%20.png)


## Usage 
This app is very easy to use. Simply input your dtc code into the input section on the landing page and hit enter or click the search button. When this is done you will be redirected to a new page that will display your results. This page will also present you with a map full of markers indicating the location of the nearest automotive shops. You can input your zip code, city, or address and it will display results in a radius based off the location the user inputs.
